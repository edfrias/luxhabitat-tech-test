exercise you will need to:

        the data introduced by the user.
  - [ ] All fields must include appropriate HTML native validation.
- [ ] Upon clicking the “Load more” button, a new group of leads will be loaded and added
      below the ones already on the screen.
- [ ] The line chart will use data from the file lead-evolution.json
