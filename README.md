Create the template in html+css and implement the required functionalities. To complete the
exercise you will need to:

- [ ] Implement all elements seen in the design.
- [ ] Implement a form to add a new lead:
  - [ ] This form will be on a modal
  - [ ] Upon completion of the form, a new row on top of the table will be created with
        the data introduced by the user.
  - [ ] All fields must include appropriate HTML native validation.
- [ ] Upon clicking the “Load more” button, a new group of leads will be loaded and added
      below the ones already on the screen.
- [ ] The line chart will use data from the file lead-evolution.json
- [ ] The pie chart will use data from the file lead-by-type.json
